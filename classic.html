<p> Classic </p>
Classic is the first and earliest game mode in Mobile Legends. All other game modes use the rules in Classic as
a base. This mode gives 5v5 and the Mobile Legends experience without worrying about losing your Rank, but
your win rate will be affected, both from the hero side and the whole.​​​​ Classic Mode is suitable for beginners who
need to familiarize themselves with Mobile Legends games. You can freely choose any hero you have, along
with the Weekly Free Heroes and any trial cards you possess. However, you cannot have more than one of the
same hero on your team.
