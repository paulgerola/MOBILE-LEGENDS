<p> Brawl </p>
In Brawl Mode you are unable to choose your heroes freely. Instead you will be given a choice between two
random heroes in your inventory. This mode contains only one lane with two turrets defending the base in both
teams respectively. Brawl matches usually end in a much shorter time compared to Classic Mode and Ranked.
neThis type of match is best for raising lost credit scores due to reports and AFK behavior. </p>
The main thing that distinguishes Brawl with Classic is its simplicity. Players are only given ONE lane instead of three. </p>
-The player is given a choice between 2 random heroes.</p>
-Players who have departed the base can not re-enter the base.</p>
-Items can only be bought inside the base, in order to buy more you must die and respawn.</p>
