<p> Ranked </p>
Ranked is a competitive queue for a game that is normally played. The rank
system is used in matchmaking to ensure that all players played equally and fairly.
Players earn or lose stars if they win or lose in this mode. Warrior, Elite, Master,
Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and Mythic (Mythical Glory) are the seven ranks in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.

<p> Draft Pick </p>
When a player reaches Epic IV or higher, Draft Pick becomes available for future matches. Unlike Blind Pick,
Draft Pick allows both teams to see their heroes while being picked and bans a total of 6 heroes (3 bans for each
team) for balancing purposes. Heroes who have already been selected or banned cannot be picked for the
duration of the match.

<p> Rank system </p>
There are seven ranks in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang these are: Warrior, Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and Mythic.</p>
Each ranks has divisions written in Roman numerals and a number of stars required to be promoted to the next
division or rank. If a player exceeds the maximum number of stars in their current division or falls below zero
stars, they can advance to the next division or back to the previous division. Completing all divisions from their
current rank or being demoted from all divisions will result in a promotion to the next rank or a demotion to the previous rank.</p>
In Mythic, the stars have been replaced with points to advance to the next division. Each win earn 5–20 (in
normal Mythic) or 5–15 (in Mythical Glory) points and each loss subtracts 5–15 points depending on the rank of
the enemies. When a player reaches 600 points, Mythic transforms into Mythical Glory, which theoretically holds an infinite number of points.

<p> Star-raising and star protection </p>
There are numerous methods for increasing or preventing star loss, which leads to star-raising and star
protections. Star-raising allow players to gain an extra star when a player reaches 100% star-raising points on
the next win. Star protection allow players to avoid losing stars by reaching 100% star protection points or by
using star protection cards; however, these effects are only activated if the player lose, star protection cards are
activated first over star protection points.</p>
Star-raising and star protection points are no longer available in Mythic, so they can no longer assist players in
improving their ranks. However, star protection cards continue to work and prevent players from losing points
instead of stars. When a player obtains an additional star while on the verge of becoming Mythic, the extra star
is converted into bonus points once the Mythic placement grading is completed.
