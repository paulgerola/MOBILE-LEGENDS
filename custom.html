Custom games are very similar to Vs. AI. The difference is the players set themselves up against other people
or against AI. Players can invite friends to join, or add AI with existing buttons. Players can also add AI to the
opposing team or on your team, you can also play alone with an AI.You can also choose which mode you want to go to Custom, 
Classic, Brawl, Draft Pick and Practice. The purpose and rules of the game are exactly the same as the Classic Mode, but 
here you have the freedom to manage the number of players. You can do 1 on 1 with friends in the game, or play three against 
5 AI, or one against 5 AI.
